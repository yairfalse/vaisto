; Vaisto Example: Counter with Supervision
; The "First Light" of a new language
;
; This file demonstrates Vaisto's core thesis:
; Infrastructure as syntax, not configuration.

; A typed process with Int state
; Handles two messages: :increment and :get
(process counter 0
  :increment (+ state 1)
  :get state)

; Supervision as syntax
; If counter crashes, restart it with initial state
(supervise :one_for_one
  (counter 0))
